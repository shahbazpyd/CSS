# Learning CSS Grid Layout - Experiment 2

This project represents my second attempt at understanding and implementing CSS Grid for web page layout.  It builds upon my initial exploration and introduces some new concepts.

## Key Learnings:

* **`repeat()` function:** I learned how to use the `repeat()` function within `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` to simplify the creation of multiple columns or rows with the same size.  This is much cleaner than writing `1fr 1fr 1fr` for three equal columns, for instance.
* **Grid Area Placement and Naming:** I reinforced my understanding of placing items into specific grid areas using the `grid-area` property. I also experimented with different naming conventions for grid areas.
* **Responsive Design with Media Queries:** This exercise further solidified my understanding of how media queries can be used to create responsive grid layouts.  Specifically, I focused on adapting the layout for smaller screens by changing the grid structure to a single-column layout within the media query.
* **`grid-gap` Property:** I used the `grid-gap` property (shorthand for `row-gap` and `column-gap`) to control the spacing between grid items.
* **Spanning Rows/Columns (Commented Out):** Although not actively used in the final version, I experimented with the commented-out `grid-row: 2 / span 2;` property within the `sidebar1` and `sidebar2` rules.  This allowed me to see how elements can span multiple rows, which will be useful in future layouts.


## Experiences:

I found that using the `repeat()` function significantly simplified defining the grid columns and rows.  It made the code more concise and easier to read. I also gained more confidence in placing items within named grid areas, experimenting with different arrangements to understand how the layout changes.

The responsive design aspect, using the media query, was initially challenging in my first experiment but felt more comfortable this time. I appreciated the ability to completely restructure the grid for smaller screens, providing a more user-friendly experience on mobile devices.


## Areas for Improvement and Further Exploration:

* **Implicit vs. Explicit Grid:**  I haven't yet fully grasped the concept of implicit vs. explicit grid and how items are placed when they fall outside the defined grid areas.  This is something I need to explore further.
* **More Complex Grid Layouts:** While this exercise covered a relatively simple layout, I want to explore more complex grid arrangements involving nested grids and overlapping items.
* **Alignment Properties:** I haven't experimented much with alignment properties like `justify-items`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `align-content`.  These will be important for fine-tuning element placement within grid cells.
* **Accessibility with Grid:** I need to consider how grid layouts impact accessibility and learn how to use ARIA attributes effectively to ensure inclusive design.


This second exercise built upon my previous learnings and provided valuable experience in working with CSS Grid. I'm continuing to learn and look forward to exploring its more advanced capabilities.
